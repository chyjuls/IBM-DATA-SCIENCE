# Final Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.<br>

After six months of study, the capstone project is here!

The project starts with data cleaning and wrangling of space data scraped from the internet using an API key.
The next step will be to make some 'sense' of the data through analysis.
This project also showcases the use of git (version control) and how this can be used in project collaboration within teams by checking out and merging branches.
