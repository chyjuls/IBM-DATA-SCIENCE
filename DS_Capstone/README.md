# Final Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.<br>

After six months of study, the capstone project is here!  

The project starts with data cleaning and  wrangling of Space data scraped from the internet using an API key.
The next step will be to make some 'sense' of the data by analysis.
